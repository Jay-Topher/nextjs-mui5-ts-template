This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), [`mui-react`](https://mui.com/), [`@reduxjs-toolkit`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and [`redux-saga`](https://redux-saga.js.org/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Theming for the app has also been setup and you can customize your theme colors and fonts.

Install a http request library of your choice (e.g: Axios) and build away üöÄüöÄ

The saga and slices are not connected for ease of removal if redux-saga is not your first choice.
